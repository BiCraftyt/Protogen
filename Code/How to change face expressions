To change the face expressions you first have to create your own, though I left a demo one.

To execute the desired face you need to be inside of 

"yourusername/rpi-rgb-led-matrix/bindings/python/samples" 

and execute the code

 "sudo python3 image-viewer.py *name_of_your_image.jpg or .png*

## To create your own custom face expressions I recommend using Paint.net

It's basically a free sowftware for Windows that works very well. 

Although anything used for PixelArt should work just fine.

> [!TIP]
>  The resolution needed is 32*64 pixels

>  The code is prepared to reescale images to make them fit into the two screens but for best results, use the native resolution.

### To use the file-->
    You need to remember its full name *Example *faceexpression1.png* even the extension matters.

    And go to *replaceWithYourUserName/rpi-rgb-led-matrix/bindings/python/samples* and paste it there. 
    
    Then just execute the code with the previous command *sudo python3 image-viewer.py *yourimageNAME.png* 

##    You are all set!!
